## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Missing Supabase environment variables"
**Solution**: Check `.env` file exists and contains:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key-here
```

### Issue: "OpenAI API key not configured"
**Solution**: Set the secret in Supabase:
```bash
supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### Issue: Edge functions return 404
**Solution**: Redeploy functions:
```bash
supabase functions deploy generate-flashcards
supabase functions deploy generate-quiz
supabase functions deploy transcribe-audio
```

### Issue: Database queries fail
**Solution**:
1. Check if migration ran successfully
2. Verify RLS policies exist
3. Ensure user is authenticated

### Issue: Audio upload fails immediately
**Solution**:
1. Check file size (max 25MB)
2. Verify file format (MP3, WAV, M4A only)
3. Check browser console for errors

## ðŸ“Š Testing Workflow

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
